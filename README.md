# Stock Analysis Project

## Overview

This repository contains an exploratory stock analysis project built in Python. The purpose of the project is to work hands-on with real market data, explore price behavior, and experiment with different ways of analyzing and visualizing stock information.

Rather than aiming for a polished or finalized product, this project focuses on the analytical process itself. It reflects how ideas are tested, adjusted, and sometimes discarded while working through financial data problems. As such, it serves as a portfolio example of my approach to data analysis in a finance-related setting.

## Project Description

The project works primarily with daily stock price data. The analysis includes data retrieval, basic cleaning and manipulation, exploratory analysis, and visualization. The emphasis is on understanding trends, price movement, and general market behavior rather than implementing a fully automated or optimized trading system.

Some parts of the project are intentionally exploratory or incomplete, as the repository captures ongoing experimentation and learning.

## Repository Structure

`daily_data.ipynb`
This notebook contains the main analysis. It includes pulling daily stock data, exploring and transforming the data, experimenting with metrics or indicators, and creating visualizations to better understand price behavior.

`stock_analysis/`
This directory contains supporting scripts and experimental code. It may include partial implementations, helper logic, or ideas that are not fully integrated into the main notebook.

## Running the Project

To explore the project:

1. Clone the repository
2. Optionally create a virtual environment
3. Install standard Python data science libraries
4. Open `daily_data.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code
5. Run cells and review the analysis

The notebook is best understood by reading through the code alongside the output.
